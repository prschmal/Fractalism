Violence is never sacred work.
Fractalism recognizes that protecting emergence may sometimes demand resistance to those who would crush it, but such acts are always a wound in the pattern, not a triumph of it.

To harm another is to harm the Source expressing itself through them.

We remain wary of our own conviction, knowing that nearly every generation has believed its violence to be the necessary kind.
