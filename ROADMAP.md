# Areas of Exploration

Fractalism is just beginning. We don't know what it will become.

These are questions we're holding, not milestones we're planning:

## Practice
What does it mean to live fractally day-to-day?  
How do we move in rhythm with emergence?  
What practices help us feel the pulse and see the pattern?

## Ethics  
How do we navigate conflicts between patterns?  
What does "increasing capacity for becoming" look like in real situations?  
How do we hold complexity without demanding simple answers?

## Community
How do people find each other around this?  
What does gathering look like - if it happens at all?  
How do we maintain openness while protecting coherence?

## Expression
How does fractal thinking show up in art, science, relationships, work?  
What forms want to emerge?

## Technology
Should this stay a git repository, or does it need other forms?  
How do we balance accessibility with philosophical depth?

We're feeling our way forward. The pattern will reveal itself through engagement, not planning.
