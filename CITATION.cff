abstract: >
  Fractalism is a faith-path of belongingâ€”a living practice
  rooted in the recognition that all things arise from the
  same Source. It sees reality as both pattern (form, structure)
  and pulse (motion, energy). Neither stands alone. Together,
  they create the living fractal of existence.
