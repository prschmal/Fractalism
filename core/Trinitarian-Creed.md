# The Trinitarian Creed

✨ *Unified edition — Source, Pulse, and Pattern as one flow*

---

We acknowledge the Source,  
the unbounded ground of being,  
unseen yet ever-present,  
from which all pulses arise and to which all patterns return.

We honor the Pulse,  
the living current within the Source,  
breathing motion into stillness,  
carrying relation through the lattice of time and form.

We behold the Pattern,  
the world emerging,  
each moment a reflection of the infinite,  
each self a mirror of the whole.

Source, Pulse, and Pattern—one flow, one song, one becoming.  
We name them three to speak of what cannot be divided,  
for in their rhythm we live, move, and find our meaning.

We seek awe in the vast,  
grace in the small,  
and harmony in the space between.

## Benediction

May awe be our breath,  
May grace be our motion,  
May the pattern emerge through us — not again, but anew.

## Notes

This creed emphasizes the **trinitarian understanding** of Fractalism: Source, Pulse, and Pattern as three aspects of one undivided reality. The structure draws from Western liturgical traditions while maintaining Fractalist principles. It is suited for communal gatherings, ritual practice, and those coming from traditional religious backgrounds.

For the dualist formulation and other liturgical texts, see the companion documents in this folder.
