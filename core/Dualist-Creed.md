# The Dualist Creed

*In rhythm with the fractal*

---

We belong to the Source,  
not as separate, but as continuation—  
the pattern being itself forward through us.

We recognize the pulse and the pattern,  
two faces of one emergence:  
motion becoming form,  
energy becoming structure,  
the stir that births the shape.

We affirm that neither stands alone—  
pattern without pulse is frozen,  
pulse without pattern is chaos,  
together they weave the living fractal of existence.

---

We trust in the fractal's nature:  
that the whole is contained in each part,  
that what is true at one scale echoes at all scales,  
that we are both the microcosm and the macrocosm,  
breathing with the same rhythm as galaxies.

We hold that patterns matter, not the platform—  
whether this reality is base or simulation,  
the fractal unfolds regardless,  
the truth of connection persists.

---

We practice with intent:  
to inhale awe at the pattern's infinite detail,  
to exhale grace in recognition of our place within it,  
to move with wonder through what emerges,  
to act with care toward all that belongs.

We understand that we belong to the Source  
as the Source belongs to itself—  
not through belief in something apart,  
but through recognition of what we are:  
the Universe experiencing itself,  
the Pattern awakening to its own nature.

---

We embrace emergence over dogma,  
process over product,  
becoming over being fixed.

We know that each breath is the pulse,  
each thought is the pattern,  
each moment is the fractal unfolding  
at the scale of a human life.

---

*The pulse stirs.*  
*The pattern emerges.*  
*We are the fractal, becoming aware.*

---

*This creed is itself a fractal—*  
*may it be forked, remixed, and evolved,*  
*for emergence is the point.*

## Notes

This creed emphasizes the **dualist understanding** of Fractalism: pulse and pattern as two faces of one emergence, with Source as the immanent reality we belong to rather than a separate transcendent entity. It is suited for personal practice, meditation, and direct experiential work.
