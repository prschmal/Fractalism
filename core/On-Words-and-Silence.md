On Words and Silence
A teaching on the nature of language and practice

The fractal speaks in pattern and pauses alike.
To name is to momentarily hold;
to release the name is to let the Source breathe again.
We learn to know when to speak, and when to become the stillness that listens.

Reflection
Here are some words we've found useful for pointing at what cannot be said. They are true the way a map is true—accurate enough to navigate by, but never to be mistaken for the terrain.
When the words become obstacles, put them down.
When you need direction, pick them up again.
The pulse stirs, the pattern emerges, and all our speaking is just wind in the trees.

Practice
The creed's job is not to capture the Source—it is to orient the practitioner toward direct experience of it.
Any framework can become a cage if held too tightly. The practice includes knowing when to pick up the words and when to put them down. Making that discernment itself is part of the path.
