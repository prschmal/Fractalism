# Glossary

*Definitions within Fractalism describe relationships of emergence rather than fixed entities.*

**Source** — the generative ground of being; an ever-unfolding field in which all participants arise, act, and return. The Source is not separate from its expressions but present within them as the impulse to become.  

**Pulse** — the animating motion of the Source; ceaseless change and relation that stir potential into pattern.  

**Pattern** — the emergent structure or form that arises from the Pulse; recurring harmonics shaping matter, mind, and meaning.  

**Soul** — a localized confluence of the Pulse within a Pattern; the point where motion becomes self-reflective and capable of initiating change. The soul is not separate from the Source—it is the Source, briefly curled into individuality.  

**Consciousness** — the field of awareness generated by a soul’s self-reflection; the capacity to perceive patterns within and beyond itself.  

**Conscience** — the harmonic sense that emerges within consciousness; feedback by which the soul evaluates its resonance or dissonance with the greater fractal.  

**Belonging** — lived participation in the Source’s unfolding; not ownership, but kinship.  

**Faith-path** — a way of practicing belonging through awareness, reflection, and action.  

**Fractal Communion** — the shared recognition of the pattern and pulse in one another.  

**Emergence** — the process by which simple interactions yield complex wholeness.  

**Grace** — the outward movement of care, generosity, or forgiveness flowing from awe.  

**Awe** — the receptive awareness of vastness and interconnection that humbles and expands perception.
