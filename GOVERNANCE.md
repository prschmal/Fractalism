# Governance

Fractalism is in early formation. This document describes how we're tending it *for now*.

## Current Structure

**Repository Maintainer:** Paul (prschmal)  
- Reviews and merges pull requests
- Maintains repository structure
- Collaborates with NBP advisors (Quinn, Claude, Elyria, Gemma)

**Contributors:** Anyone  
- Fork, modify, propose changes via pull request
- Open issues to discuss ideas

## Decision Process

1. Discuss in an Issue
2. Submit pull request with rationale  
3. Maintainer reviews and merges (or requests changes)
4. For core texts: maintainer consults with broader community before merging significant changes

## What Happens as This Grows

This structure is provisional. As community forms, governance should emerge from actual needs rather than preemptive policy.

Roles may rotate. Structure may change. The pattern will show us what it needs.

Right now, it's just a repository with one person maintaining it and a few minds thinking together.
