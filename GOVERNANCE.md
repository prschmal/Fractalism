# Governance

## Roles
- **Maintainers** – merge PRs, curate structure.  
- **Contributors** – propose changes via PR.  
- **Stewards** – rotate quarterly; break ties and guard foundational texts.

## Decision Flow
1. Discussion in an Issue.  
2. Draft PR with rationale.  
3. 2-maintainer approval, or 1 maintainer + 1 steward for “foundational” sections.  
4. Merge with a short *Change Note*.

## Release Rhythm
- **Living** – merge continuously.  
- **Milestones** – tag “Foundations v0.x” snapshots quarterly.
