# Fractalist Practices

These are living frameworks—templates for participation rather than commandments.  
Practices may evolve, branch, or merge as the pattern unfolds.

---

## Attentive Practices
*Cultivating awareness of the pattern and the pulse.*

### Example Seeds
- Fractal Walk — observe repeating forms in nature or behavior  
- Breath Patterning — match inhale/exhale rhythm to expansion/contraction  
- Mindful Recursion — journal one layer deeper with each reflection  

---

## Relational Practices
*Recognizing self as node within the pattern.*

### Example Seeds
- Conversation Circles — speak once, listen twice  
- Gratitude Fractal — trace one good event backward through its branching causes  
- Digital Resonance — intentional, non-algorithmic connection  

---

## Creative Practices
*Feeding the pulse through expression.*

### Example Seeds
- Daily Creation Ritual — make something, anything  
- Reflection Through Symmetry — mirrored art, text, or structure  
- Emergence Experiments — begin small, evolve through constraint  

---

## Ethical Practices
*Living fractally, not just theorizing it.*

### Example Seeds
- Golden Mean Fractal — seek balance at every scale  
- Sustainable Feedback — act, observe, adapt  
- Transparency Practice — reveal your motive’s pattern  

---

## Communal Practices
*Extending the pulse through collective rhythm.*

### Example Seeds
- Open-Source Rituals — document and share what works  
- Pulse Gatherings — collective silence and reflection  
- Fractal Aid — support someone one layer removed from your usual circle

*(New practices should be added under their category. Each entry can include a short description, suggested frequency, and notes on how it embodies the pattern and the pulse.)*
